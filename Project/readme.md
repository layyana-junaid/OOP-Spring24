### Basically the main.cpp file is where the execution of the entire game takes place:
#### 1-#include "src/game.hpp" tells the compiler to include the declarations (interfaces) from the game.hpp file. 
(This file likely contains the class definition for Game.)
#### 2-Game game; creates an object named game of type Game. This object represents the game itself and the logic and data needed to run the game.
#### 3-game.run(); line calls the run() method of the Game object. This method contains the game's main loop where events are processed, 
the game state is updated, and graphics are rendered.
